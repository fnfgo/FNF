# Current issues

- Lime 8.0.0 seems to have issues with rendering sometimes (Some stuff like FlxText's might seem a little bit more pixelated) [NOT AN ENGINE ISSUE]

- When switching to another app and coming back to game framerate is capped to 60

- FPS cap seems to get lower whenever ending songs or leaving them
